# KrunkWebGFXMaker
a krunker web GFX creator to get new people accustomed to 3d software, NOT to be used on a professional setting


note: I did not make THREE.js, GLTFLoader.js, OrbitControls.js, or dat.gui.js, all can be found at https://threejs.org, these files have been modified slightly to fit a more minimul size for installation
